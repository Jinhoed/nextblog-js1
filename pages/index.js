        <p>Hi im Jhenno!</p>
        <p>Hello, I'm Jhenno, a 22-year-old with a love for playing basketball, hitting the gym, and listening to rap, phonk, and lo-fi </p> 
        <p> I dove into the world of esports at 18 and currently play as a professional Valorant player for NAOS ESPORTS. But right now, I took break and am here to take my remaining dropped subjects because of my interfering schedule. My passion merges with my job. Beyond esports, I do a bit of game development and 3D modeling, and I have studied sound engineering online. Though I'll admit, numbers and math are not really my thing.</p>
